a
specialty
paper
used
for
making
cigarettes
(commercially
manufactured
filter
cigarettes
and
individually
made
roll-your-own
cigarettes).
Rolling
papers
are
packs
of
several
cigarette-size
sheets,
often
folded
inside
a
cardboard
wrapper.

Composition[edit]
Several
brands
of
rolling
papers
Cigarette
paper
is
made
from
thin
and
lightweight
"rag
fibers"
(nonwood
plant
fibers)
such
as
flax,
hemp,
sisal,
rice
straw,
and
esparto.
The
paper
is
available
in
rolls
and
rectangular
sheets
of
varying
sizes,
and
has
a
narrow
strip
of
glue
along
one
long
edge.
It
may
be
transparent,
colored
and
flavored.
It
has
a
high
filler
content
and
a
basis
weight
of
10-28
g/m².
To
control
the
smoking
properties,
this
paper
has
a
porosity
that
is
suited
to
the
type
of
tobacco
and
contains
additives
that
regulate
burning.&#91;1&#93;
One
critical
paper
characteristic
is
permeability;
its
primary
physical
influence
is
smoke
dilution.
Among
the
fillers
used
are
calcium
carbonate
to
influence
the
permeability
and
color,
magnesium
carbonate
to
improve
ash
color,
or
titanium
oxide
if
a
particularly
white
ash
is
required.&#91;2&#93;
Sodium
potassium
tartrate
(Seignette's
salt),
sodium
and
potassium
citrate
are
used
as
a
combustion
regulator
in
cigarette
paper,
increased
levels
result
in
faster
burning
papers.&#91;3&#93;
Poly(vinyl
alcohol)
in
aqueous
solution
is
used
for
cigarette
adhesives.&#91;4&#93;
Permeability
is
defined
as
the
measure
of
the
volume
of
air
that
flows
through
a
specified
area
of
cigarette
paper
in
a
given
unit
of
time.
It
is
measured
in
CORESTA
units.
US
commercial
filter
cigarette
brands
have
paper
permeability
between
14
and
51
CORESTA
units.
Increased
cigarette
paper
permeability
results
in
increased
smoke
dilution
with
air.&#91;5&#93;
Other
specialty
papers
for
tobacco
products
are:
Imitation
cork
paper
is
a
brownish
yellow
colored
paper
used
for
the
production
of
cigarette
tips.
It
has
an
imitation
cork
imprint
and
joins
the
filter
to
the
tobacco
stick.
Filter
encasing
paper
is
used
for
the
production
of
acetate
or
cellulose
filters.
The
tip
paper
may
be
covered
with
polyvinyl
alcohol.&#91;6&#93;
Cigar
or
cigarillo
casing
paper
holds
the
chopped
tobacco
together
and
serves
as
the
inner
casing.
Consumption[edit]
In
the
United
States
of
America,
Tobacconist
Magazine
has
called
roll-your-own
(RYO)
the
tobacco
industry's
fastest
growing
segment.
It
estimates
that
2-4%
of
cigarette
smokers
in
the
United
States,
or
approximately
2.6
million
people,
make
their
own
cigarettes.
Many
of
these
smokers
have
switched
in
response
to
increasingly
high
taxes
on
manufactured
cigarettes.&#91;7&#93;
In
2000,
a
Canadian
government
survey
estimated
that
9%
of
Canada's
6,000,000
cigarette
smokers
smoked
hand-rolled
cigarettes
"sometimes
or
most
of
the
time",
7%
smoked
roll-your-owns
"exclusively",
and
over
90%
of
rolling
papers
sold
in
Canada
were
for
tobacco
consumption.
A
more
recent
2009
study
has
shown
that
approximately
925,000
Canadians
roll
their
own
cigarettes.&#91;8&#93;
According
to
The
Publican,
"Low
price
RYO
has
seen
an
astonishing
rise
of
175%
in
[2007]
as
cigarette
smokers
look
for
cheaper
alternatives
and
to
control
the
size
of
their
smoke".&#91;9&#93;
The
National
Health
Service
in
the
United
Kingdom
has
reported
that
roll-your-own
use
has
more
than
doubled
since
1990,
from
11%
to
24%.
Many
of
these
smokers
apparently
believe
that
hand-rolled
cigarettes
are
less
harmful
than
manufactured
products,&#91;10&#93;
although
it
is
equally
possible
that
the
increase
is
due
to
the
steep
rise
in
prices
since
the
early-1990s
to
the
present
day.&#91;11&#93;
In
Thailand,
roll-your-own
smokers
have
long
exceeded
those
for
manufactured
brands;&#91;12&#93;
the
cheaper
papers
without
gum
are
kept
constantly
between
the
fingers
during
a
smoke
there.
New
Zealand
reported
in
2005
that:
'The
ratio
of
roll-your-own
to
manufactured
or
tailor-made
cigarettes
consumed
by
New
Zealanders
has
risen
over
(at
least)
the
past
decade,
perhaps
reflecting
price
differences
between
these
products,
and
currently
approaching
50
percent
overall.'&#91;13&#93;
Taxation[edit]
Consumers'
switching
to
roll-your-own
has
led
to
a
response
among
certain
tax
authorities.
In
the
United
States,
Indiana
and
Kentucky
tax
rolling
papers.
Kentucky
set
its
tax
at
$0.25
per
pack
(for
up
to
32
leaves,
larger
packs
are
taxed
at
$0.0078
per
leaf)
in
2006
despite
complaints
from
manufacturers.
Louisiana
Revised
Statute
47:338.261
allows
up
to
$1.25
per
pack
at
retail.
Regulation[edit]
The
FDA
stated
in
2011
that
every
brand
(including
private
labels)
of
cigarette
rolling
papers
sold
in
the
US
must
submit
their
ingredients
and
seek
agency
approval
or
withdraw
from
the
marketplace
by
March
of
that
year
if
they
had
not
been
sold
in
the
US
before
February
15,
2007.&#91;14&#93;
Actionism[edit]
The
Spanish
brand
of
Smoking
was
charged
in
Spanish
Court
for
using
illegal
carcinogenic
materials
in
their
cigarette
papers
to
cut
costs,
namely
esparto.
However,
the
company
was
never
convicted.&#91;15&#93;
Fire-resistant
applications[edit]
Fire-resistant
cigarettes,
which
reduce
the
risk
of
fire
from
unattended
cigarettes,
are
made
with
special
paper
that
includes
a
plastic
compound,
ethylene
vinyl
acetate.
If
a
cigarette
made
with
this
type
of
paper
is
left
unattended,
the
plastic
in
the
paper
will
help
the
cigarette
self-extinguish.

Plot[edit]
Mrs.
Streibel,
the
art
teacher,
gives
the
boys
detention
for
making
a
phallus
out
of
clay
in
art
class.
Enraged,
they
take
revenge
by
toilet
papering
her
house
that
night.
Kyle
is
horrified
to
discover
that
she
has
kids
and
soon
regrets
the
deed,
later
having
nightmares
about
it.
The
next
day,
the
boys
are
called
to
the
counsellor's
office,
and
Cartman
comes
up
with
a
ridiculously
elaborate
alibi.
With
Kyle
struggling
to
comprehend
the
details
of
this
convoluted
story,
Cartman
grows
concerned
that
he
may
confess.
Cartman
decides
to
eliminate
the
risk
of
Kyle
confessing
by
taking
matters
into
his
own
hands.
He
takes
Kyle
on
a
boat
ride
on
Stark's
Pond
and
begins
to
beat
him
to
death
with
a
wiffle
bat,
which
was
the
only
weapon
he
could
afford.
Kyle,
nevertheless,
is
so
guilt-ridden
that
he
does
not
defend
himself.
Officer
Barbrady
absurdly
exaggerates
the
weight
of
the
crime
and
begins
an
investigation
(since
he
really
has
nothing
better
to
do
that
day),
but
is
unable
to
come
up
with
any
solid
leads.
He
seeks
help
from
Josh,
a
convicted
toilet-paperer,
who
is
serving
a
three-week
sentence
in
Park
County
Juvenile
Hall
for
toilet
papering
over
600
houses
in
less
than
a
year.
After
several
interviews,
during
which
Josh
applies
psychological
pressure
on
Barbrady,
he
comes
a
little
closer
to
solving
the
case.
Later,
Barbrady
forces
a
confession
out
of
Butters
after
injecting
him
with
sodium
pentothal
and
interrogating
him
for
over
forty
hours,
but
Butters'
parents,
furious,
arrive
to
absolve
him
for
confessing
(yet
again)
to
a
crime
that
he
did
not
commit.
After
seeing
Butters
get
in
trouble
for
their
actions,
Stan
and
Kenny
are
finally
convinced
that
they
ought
to
confess.
Stan
tells
Cartman
that,
if
he
has
a
conscience,
he
will
do
the
same.
Cartman,
however,
is
completely
oblivious
to
the
concept
of
"feeling
bad
for
other
people"
and
is
utterly
bewildered
at
his
friends'
reasoning.
The
next
morning,
Barbrady
brings
Josh
along
with
him
to
Principal
Victoria's
office,
but
before
he
can
speak,
Mr.
Mackey
announces
that
the
true
toilet
paperer
has
already
confessed.
Just
then,
Stan,
Kyle
and
Kenny
rush
into
the
office,
only
to
find
out
that
it
is
Cartman,
having
obviously
done
it
in
a
bid
to
secure
a
better
deal
for
himself:
each
of
the
boys
ends
up
with
two-week
detention,
except
for
Cartman,
who
gets
only
one
for
"being
brave"
(Cartman
considered
it
a
pyrrhic
victory,
as
he
later
laments
having
to
spend
one
week
of
detention).
Kyle
is
outraged
and
he
finds
this
unfair
because
he
was
supposed
to
confess
and
do
the
right
thing
not
Cartman.
Josh
manages
to
trick
the
police
and
flee.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
episode,
he
calls
Officer
Barbrady
and
thanks
him
for
enabling
his
escape.
Despite
Barbrady's
pleas—"Josh,
you
have
to
go
back
to
Juvenile
Hall:
you
only
have
a
three-week
sentence!"—Josh
puts
down
the
phone
and,
armed
with
bags
of
toilet
paper,
slowly
approaches
the
White
House
as
sinister
music
plays
in
the
background.
Cultural
references[edit]
Josh's
scenes
and
feigned
behavior
are
an
allusion
to
the
character
Hannibal
Lecter
from
Thomas
Harris'
novels,
particularly
the
then-recent
Red
Dragon
and
Anthony
Hopkins'
portrayal
of
the
character.&#91;1&#93;
The
scene
in
which
the
boys
toilet
paper
Mrs.
Dreibel's
house
is
a
reference
to
the
film
Platoon.
(Adagio
for
Strings
by
Samuel
Barber
plays
in
the
background).&#91;1&#93;
In
the
same
scene,
Kyle's
hesitance
to
toilet
paper
Mrs.
Dreibel's
house
when
he
sees
her
children
is
a
reference
to
Scarface,
when
Tony
Montana
does
not
wish
to
assassinate
a
UN
lobbyist
with
his
family.&#91;1&#93;
In
Kyle's
second
dream
sequence
is
real
footage
of
figure
skater
Nancy
Kerrigan
screaming
"Why!?
Why!?"
after
her
attack.&#91;1&#93;
The
scenes
where
Cartman
takes
Kyle
out
on
a
"boat
ride"
and
the
one
where
he
takes
all
three
boys
out
for
one
are
references
to
the
movie
The
Godfather
Part
II,
when
Michael
Corleone
orders
Al
Neri
to
take
Michael's
brother
Fredo
on
a
fishing
trip
to
be
killed.&#91;1&#93;

Sinopsis[editar]
Los
chicos
son
castigados
por
su
maestra
de
arte
y
deciden
vengarse.
Por
la
noche,
van
a
su
casa
y
la
empapelan
con
papel
de
inodoro.
Pero
ahora,
la
policía
los
busca
recurriendo
a
un
niño
(parodia
de
Hannibal)
y
Kyle
siente
remordimiento.
Trama[editar]
La
Srta.
Streibel,
la
maestra
de
arte,
castiga
a
los
chicos
por
hacer
un
pene
de
arcilla
en
clase
de
arte.
Enfurecidos,
toman
venganza
empapelando
su
casa
con
papel
de
inodoro
esa
noche.
Kyle
se
horroriza
al
descubrir
que
ella
tiene
hijos
y
pronto
lamenta
el
hecho,
que
después
ha
tenido
pesadillas
al
respecto.
Al
día
siguiente,
los
chicos
son
llamados
a
la
oficina
del
consejero,
y
a
Cartman
se
le
ocurre
una
coartada
ridículamente
complicada.
Con
Kyle
tratando
de
comprender
los
detalles
de
esta
historia
enrevesada,
Cartman
está
preocupado
de
que
pueda
confesar.
Cartman
decide
eliminar
el
riesgo
de
que
Kyle
confiese
tomando
el
asunto
en
sus
propias
manos.
Toma
a
Kyle
en
un
paseo
en
barco
por
el
Estanque
de
Stark
y
comienza
a
golpearlo
con
un
bate
de
plástico,
que
era
la
única
arma
que
podía
ofrecer.
Kyle,
sin
embargo,
está
tan
cargado
de
culpa
que
él
no
se
defiende.
El
Oficial
Barbrady
absurdamente
exagera
el
peso
del
crimen
y
comienza
una
investigación,
pero
no
puede
llegar
a
ninguna
pista
sólida.
Él
busca
la
ayuda
de
Josh,
un
condenado
en
el
Centro
de
Máxima
Seguridad
Juvenil
Alamosa,
que
está
cumpliendo
una
condena
de
tres
semanas
en
él
por
empapelar
más
de
600
casas
con
papel
de
baño
en
menos
de
un
año.
Después
de
varias
entrevistas,
en
la
que
Josh
aplica
presión
psicológica
a
Barbrady,
llega
un
poco
más
cerca
de
resolver
el
caso.
Más
tarde,
Barbrady
fuerza
una
confesión
de
Butters
después
de
inyectarle
sodio
pentatol
e
interrogarlo
durante
más
de
cuarenta
horas,
pero
los
padres
de
Butters,
furiosos,
dicen
que
él
estaba
con
ellos
a
la
hora
del
suceso.
Después
de
ver
que
Butters
se
mete
en
problemas
por
sus
acciones,
Stan
y
Kenny
finalmente
se
convencen
de
que
debían
confesar.
Stan
le
dice
a
Cartman
que,
si
él
tiene
una
conciencia,
que
vaya
a
confesar.
Cartman;
sin
embargo,
es
completamente
ajeno
al
concepto
de
"sentirse
mal
por
los
demás"
y
está
completamente
desconcertado
en
el
razonamiento
de
sus
amigos.
A
la
mañana
siguiente,
Josh
es
llevado
por
Barbrady
a
la
oficina
de
la
Directora
Victoria,
pero
antes
de
que
pueda
hablar,
el
Sr.
Mackey
anuncia
que
ya
confesaron.
Justo
en
ese
momento,
Stan,
Kyle
y
Kenny
iban
a
confesar,
sólo
para
descubrir
que
se
trata
de
Cartman,
habiéndolo
hecho
en
un
intento
de
asegurar
un
mejor
trato
para
sí
mismo:
cada
uno
de
los
chicos
termina
con
la
detención
dos
semanas,
excepto
por
Cartman,
quien
tiene
una
sola
por
"ser
valiente".
Kyle
se
indigna
porque
él
quería
confesar
y
hacer
lo
correcto,
no
Cartman.
Josh
se
las
arregla
para
engañar
a
la
policía
y
huir.
Al
final
del
episodio,
Josh
llama
a
Barbrady
y
le
da
las
gracias
por
permitir
su
escape.
A
pesar
de
que
Barbrady
le
suplica:
"Josh,
tienes
que
volver
al
reformatorio
tu
sentencia
es
de
tres
semanas",
Josh
cuelga
el
teléfono
y,
armado
con
bolsas
de
papel
de
baño,
se
acerca
lentamente
a
la
Casa
Blanca
con
música
siniestra
de
fondo.

Synopsis
Cartman
convinces
the
boys
to
toilet
paper
their
art
teacher's
house
as
revenge
for
keeping
them
after
school.
After
the
fact,
Kyle
is
overwhelmed
with
guilt
and
on
the
verge
of
confessing
his
part
in
the
prank.
Officer
Barbrady
is
hot
on
the
perpetrators'
trail,
while
Cartman
contemplates
killing
Kyle
so
he
doesn't
rat
them
out.
Plot
Spoiler
warning!
Plot
details
follow.
The
boys
have
to
stay
after
school
for
building
an
erect
penis
out
of
clay
in
art
class.
Annoyed
about
their
punishment,
they
take
revenge
by
toilet
papering
the
art
teacher
Mrs.
Streibel's
house
during
the
night.
Kyle
is
horrified
to
discover
that
Mrs.
Streibel
has
kids.
He
regrets
their
actions
and
has
nightmares
about
their
misdeed,
and
the
Streibel
family.
The
next
day,
the
boys
are
called
to
the
counselor's
office.
Frightened
that
they
may
be
interrogated
about
what
happened
to
the
Streibel
family,
Cartman
comes
up
with
a
bogus
alibi:
"Last
night,
all
four
of
us
were
at
the
bowling
alley
until
about
7:30,
at
which
time
we
noticed
Ally
Sheedy,
the
Goth
chick
from
the
Breakfast
Club,
was
bowling
in
the
lane
next
to
us,
and
we
asked
her
for
her
autograph,
but
she
didn't
have
a
pen,
so
we
followed
her
out
to
her
car,
but
on
the
way
we
were
accosted
by
five
Scientologists
who
wanted
to
give
us
all
personality
tests,
which
were
administered
at
the
Scientology
Center
in
Denver
until
10:45,
at
which
time
we
accidentally
boarded
the
wrong
bus
home
and
ended
up
in
Rancho
de
Burritos
Rojos,
south
of
Castle
Rock,
and
finally
got
a
ride
home
with
a
man
who
was
missing
his
left
index
finger,
named
Gary
Bushwell,
arriving
home
around
11:46."
Kyle
is
confused
on
the
details
of
the
story,
and
Cartman
grows
concerned
that
Kyle
might
confess.
Meanwhile,
Officer
Barbrady
investigates
the
crime,
but
is
unable
to
come
up
with
any
solid
clues.
He
seeks
help
from
Josh,
a
convicted
toilet
paperer,
who
is
currently
serving
a
sentence
in
Park
County
Juvenile
Hall
for
toilet
papering
over
600
houses
in
less
than
a
year.
After
several
sessions
with
Josh,
in
which
Josh
applies
psychological
pressure
to
Barbrady,
he
comes
a
little
closer
to
solving
the
case.
The
four
boys
are
also
interrogated.
Cartman
decides
to
eliminate
the
risk
of
Kyle
confessing
by
taking
him
out
late
at
night
on
a
boat
in
Stark's
Pond
to
kill
him
with
a
wiffle
bat.
Meanwhile,
Barbrady
forces
a
confession
out
of
Butters,
injecting
him
with
sodium
pentothal
as
a
truth
serum;
but
his
parents
ground
him
for
lying
and
confessing
to
a
crime
he
didn't
commit.
After
seeing
Butters
get
in
trouble
for
their
actions,
Kyle
is
finally
able
to
convince
Stan
and
Kenny
that
they
should
confess.
Stan
tells
Cartman
that
if
he
has
any
thread
of
a
conscience,
which
as
it
turns
out
he
doesn't,
he'll
do
the
same.
The
next
morning,
Barbrady
brings
Josh
along
with
him
to
Principal
Victoria's
office,
but
she
insists
that
the
true
toilet
paperer
has
already
confessed,
referring
to
Butters.
Stan,
Kyle,
and
Kenny
rush
into
the
office,
only
to
find
out
that
Cartman
had
already
confessed
to
get
a
less
harmful
punishment;
making
the
other
boys
look
bad.
Each
of
them
received
two
weeks
of
detention,
while
Cartman
got
only
one
week
for
"being
brave",
although
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
one
week
of
detention
is
still
a
terrible
price
to
pay.
Meanwhile,
Josh
manages
to
trick
the
police,
and
flee.
Later,
he
calls
Officer
Barbrady
to
tell
him
there's
something
he
must
do.
The
final
scene
shows
him
approaching
the
White
House
with
toilet
paper
as
sinister
music
plays
in
the
background.
