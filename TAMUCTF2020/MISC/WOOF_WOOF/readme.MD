Texas A&M's own Miss Reveille has been followed going to the Computing Services Complex by paparazi from The Battalion. Since she wants to keep this visit to the CSC private, we have apprehended the cameras from the paparazzi and have begun deleting all the photos. However, during our investigation we came across one photo that seemed a little suspicious. Can you help us figure out what is happening?
