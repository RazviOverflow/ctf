My friend wrote a cool program to encode text data! His code is sometimes hard to understand, and only he knows how it works. I ran the program twice, but forgot the input I used for the first time. I didn't save the key I used either, but I know it was 15 characters long. Can you figure out what text I encoded the first time?

Output 1 Input 2 Output 2
