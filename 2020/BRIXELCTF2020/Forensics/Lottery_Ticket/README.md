Someone is trying to sell this lottery ticket online, it has the winning numbers but I suspect foul play

Can you tell me which the new numbers are that are photoshopped?

Add them all up, the resulting number is the flag

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format
