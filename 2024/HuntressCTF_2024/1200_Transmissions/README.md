Wait, there aren't actually 1200 transmissions in this file, are there?

WARNING: The audio in this file is very loud and obnoxious. Please turn your volume way down before playing.

# Solution
The 1200 transimissions is a reference to old modem era. This writeup solves a very similar challenge: https://ctftime.org/writeup/23189mi

`sudo apt install minimodem`

And then simply: 
`$ minimodem -r -f transmissions.wav 1200`
