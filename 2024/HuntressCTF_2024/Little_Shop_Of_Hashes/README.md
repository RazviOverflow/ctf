In the packet, secrets lie,
Whispers of data pass by,
Encrypted shadows creep,
While the watchful eyes peep.

Are you able to unravel the attack chain? The first question is:
What is the name of the service that the attacker ran and stopped, which dumped hashes on the first compromised host?


NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

To export from .evtx to .xml or .txt you can use `$ sudo apt install libevtx-utils`-> `evtxexport`.
