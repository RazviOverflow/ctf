# Solution
Once again, looking for the MD5 on ANY.RUN results in several previous analyses. The obfuscated powershell performs several actions, one of them contains the flag. It can be seen in the details of the powershell process of the analyses. For example: https://app.any.run/tasks/2e8ec6e2-03bd-450b-b6a9-9b2e92b7ed32?p=6717f3985480d7602ad48943 On the left menu, click on Script Tracer -> PowerShell.

One of the actions is: iex  # flag{8ba43de1e095287dbbf7722e51239a63}

# Challenge flag{8ba43de1e095287dbbf7722e51239a63}
