# Writing on the Wall
As you approach a password-protected door, a sense of uncertainty envelops youâ€”no clues, no hints. Yet, just as confusion takes hold, your gaze locks onto cryptic markings adorning the nearby wall. Could this be the elusive password, waiting to unveil the door's secrets?

# Solution
The binary performs a `strcmp` between two strings whose 1st byte can we overwritten by the user. Solution: overwrite the first byte of each string with the nullbyte therefore performing no cmp at all -> `strcmp("","")` is always true.

Solved by running: `$ python3 -c 'print("\x00ABCDE\x00")' | ncat IP PORT`
