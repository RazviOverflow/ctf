I feel the killer might be dangerous so I have some info to give you but I don't want to disclose my email just like that. So find my review from the image below and send me an email asking for info. Be creative with the signature so I know its you. It is time to find Who is the killer.

## Solution

The image is this place: https://www.google.com/maps/@41.155504,-8.6805483,3a,75y,80.42h,92.7t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbDzzaeIYxtlnWnKuvcLawA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192

In the reviews, an email is shown: noodlesareramhackers@gmail.com

Sent an email to that address, answered with:
```
So... I got some stuff to tell you. I think the killer is probably watching us. The killer used a weird weapon as you have found out. Look, the info I have is that weirdly enough the university page of Heather tweeted something that might lead you to the killer. They deleted it though. Luckily these days you can just walk back in time! Ah, the tweet was 1612383535549059076. When you have the info look in github!
Good Luck!
