The snapchat story reveals car's plate: UP15CD0234. Using Indian's government page reveals no information about the owner's name. But we got some insights about registration date. https://vahan.nic.in/nrservices/faces/user/searchVehicleDetails.xhtml. To get the owner's name we used and Android App called 'Vehicle Owner Details'. This application does not censor the licence owner name while the government does. Lol. The flag is: Trollcat{arvind_19012017}
