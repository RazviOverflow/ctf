Print N Lowest Numbers
25
Below is some C/C++ code that reads a list of integers from stdin and calls PrintNLowestNumbers. Implement PrintNLowestNumbers, which takes an int array of these integers, an int representing the length of that integer array , and an unsigned short nLowest, which indicates how many of the lowest numbers in the integer array are to be printed to stdout. The printed integers must be printed in order (lowest to highest) and should each be seperated by a space character and nothing else.
