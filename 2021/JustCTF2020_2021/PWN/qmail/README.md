Qmail
One of the internet leaders launched an anti-spam mail checking service. You send it an email content and you get an aggregated score from multiple systems. However, it seems that something broke as the service doesn't respond from time to time. Am I sending content in EMail Message format? A mistake on their part seems implausible.
